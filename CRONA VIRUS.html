                <b>WE ARE focused on the right to science.</b> For 28 years—during which time New York City evolved from being the epicenter of the HIV epidemic to a leader in ending it—TAGline has been a lifeline of information, and a rallying cry for
                political will and evidence-based action. This edition is especially timely, as we confront the challenges of the novel coronavirus and the danger of abandoning the efforts to end HIV, tuberculosis, and hepatitis C. We dedicate this TAGline
                to those we’ve lost to the COVID-19 pandemic, including Professor Gita Ramjee, whose HIV research embodied the right to science. As we note in our dedication, “only when science and human rights prevail over politics and grandstanding
                can we mitigate to the fullest extent possible the harms and losses from these pandemics.” In this issue of TAGline you’ll find: Realizing the Right to Science By Erica Lessem and Suraj Madoori The Right to Science Finally Comes into Sight

        <p><b>This dedicated resource hub on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease represents a collaborative project of the COVID-19 Working Group NY, the PrEP4All Collaboration, AVAC, and Treatment Action Group. Our perspective is rooted in the lessons
            learned from the HIV research response that began in the 1980s and 1990s and—along with our advocacy around leading HIV coinfections hepatitis C virus (HCV) and tuberculosis (TB)—continues today. We know from experience that informing and
            engaging health advocates from vulnerable and disproportionately affected communities is an essential part of a coordinated public health and research response to a novel infectious disease. Accelerating access to reliable options for diagnosis,
            prevention, and treatment is critical. Rigorous scientific protocols are essential, even and especially in a pandemic. While objecting to unethical or unscientific research, we are also part of working to find solutions to achieve well-designed
            research including randomized controlled trials, while advocating to overcome structural, policy, and pricing and other access barriers. The emergence of a new pandemic can lead to media hype, misinformation, and the promotion of interventions
            that lack supportive scientific evidence. This puts patients at risk and could lead to increased transmission due to loss of faith in non-pharmaceutical interventions that we know are effective in slowing COVID-19 transmission. Interpreting
            and understanding rapidly evolving scientific research can be challenging for the media and public. This challenge is exacerbated in the current era of social media and the broader availability or “preprint” research papers that have not yet
            undergone review by scientific peers. Even among peer-reviewed research, quality of data and the relationship between the data and the authors’ conclusions (both in the publication and in media engagement) is widely variable. We aim to provide
            here independent analysis and information resources with a particular focus on the research pipelines for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. Our main COVID-19 Pipeline page contains statements
            and resources on key topics. </b>Our Myth Busters page debunks common and dangerous myths. For the latest public comments and publications on COVID-19 from TAG and partners, check out our Newsfeed, and for more on COVID-19 from external sources,
            please visit our Resources page. Guiding Principles for Our Work Are: High-quality, ethical, rigorous, well-designed, well-controlled clinical trials are essential for strengthening our ability to diagnose, treat, and prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection
            and COVID-19 disease. People at risk for or living with COVID-19 disease have a right to receive diagnosis, prevention, and treatment based on strong basic research and validated through high-quality, ethical, rigorous, well-designed, well-controlled
            clinical trials. <mark> disproportionately at risk for SARS-CoV-2 </mark>infection and COVID-19 disease– as well as experienced community health and research advocates– must be involved in the design, execution, and analysis of clinical trials
            during this pandemic, and in plans for rolling out benefits from scientific advances. People at higher risk of severe disease must be included in clinical trials of interventions for COVID-19 with the highest quality informed consent. Risk
            factors include <strong></strong> such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, kidney or liver disease, as well as age. This means that many people co-infected with HIV, HCV, and TB, among other coinfections, may be at increased
            risk for worse outcomes resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection and must be involved in</strong> clinical research. Knowledge and products generating from research, especially when publicly funded, must be widely available, equitably accessible,
            and affordable. For any questions regarding our<b> COVID-19 materials, please contact communications@treatmentactiongroup.org. These resources were initially made possible by generous support from David Gold, Dr. Michael Giordano, and the Columbia University
            School of Social Work. Additional donations are welcome and will help </b>us keep these resources updated. Donations from the following supporters have helped TAG continue to update and share life-saving information:</p>
