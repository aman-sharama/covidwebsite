                    As science-based activists, the right of everyone “to share in scientific advancement and its benefits”1 —or more simply, the right to science—offers tremendous potential for our work. Yet this right has been underexplored and underutilized. Under the
                    leadership of Mike Frick, now codirector of our TB project, TAG began framing our advocacy within a right to science lens in 2015, adding to the small but growing body of work to understand and apply the right.2 Building off the body
                    of work that has resulted over the past five years, we decided to dedicate an edition of TAGline to the right,
                    <P>
                        <font color="red">in light of upcoming official detailed communications on what the right to science means (see Frick page 4). We had no idea that by edition launch, we’d be in the throes of a pandemic, with the need to realize the right to science
                            more important than ever. The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the resultant pandemic of</font> COVID-19 </P>disease facilitated by many countries’ horrible mismanagement of it, are tragic demonstrations of why the right</P>
                to science is so
                <BR> essential. Science underpins all the tools we need to combat a pandemic: evidence-driven epidemiology and public policy; sound information and public communications; and eventually, new diagnostics, therapeutics, and possibly vaccines.
                Only a science-based response will get us out of this with as minimal impact and lives lost as possible. Such a response requires strong political will and effectual governments to make adequate fiscal and policy investments to—in the
                language of the right
                <P id="A">to science—both develop and diffuse those advances to all who need them. On the investment side, we see clearly from recent events that waiting until an emergency to make investments
                    <P>in research and development (R&D) means that highquality, life-saving tools come far too late. While it can be hard, if not impossible, to predict what pathogen will explode as the next global health crisis, proactive and sustained

                        <FONT COLOR="BLUE">free market-driven approach to R&D means that many companies have abandoned their infectious disease drug and vaccine development units in favor of more lucrative, yet less essential therapeutic areas. Chronic underfunding of science
                            directly threatens the rigor of biomedical research, with fewer resources to conduct and power randomized controlled trials to generate quality data.3 Underinvesting in research and accepting potentially biased or anecdotal
                            evidence in place of randomized trials result in weak guidelines and challenge
                            <BR>
                    </P> uptake of new interventions. Sustained and increased investments in public research institutions, such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health, are critical for building a basic science knowledge base to understand conditions
                    and underpin product development, as well as providing funding opportunities to attract private sector endeavors. Investments also ensure that our best and brightest engage in advancing crucial research, while bringing promising, earlycareer
                    researchers into the fields of emerging and neglected infectious diseases. But developing the tools is only half of the battle. Making sure they equitably reach those affected is equally
                    <P>essential. With the
                        <P>COVID-19 pandemic, we are already seeing the breakdown of who benefits from science, including publicly-funded science, as we continue to see with the HIV, TB, and HCV epidemics. This inequity applies both within and across borders.
                            For example, though the human right to science and its benefits is universal, the ability to obtain testing for COVID-19 </P>hugely depends upon in which country one lives (compare early testing rates in South Korea versus
                        the U.S., for example)3 as well as how resources and health care coverage</P> are distributed within a country.4 A particularly egregious example of this breakdown is President Trump attempting to buy exclusive rights to a vaccine
                    candidate from a German company, with an eye toward making it </FONT> available only in the U.S.5 Or the case of U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Azar not committing to ensure that any vaccine developed would be affordable.6
                    In a time where rapid and unfettered access is vital, the policies lobbied by industry in the name of protecting innovation and intellectual property rights are barriers to meeting urgent health needs and limits the realization of
                    the right to science for all. So while economic stimulus packages to incentivize private sector development may help produce
